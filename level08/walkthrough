* in this challenge the program expect to have one argument, if not it display the usage.
* calls fopen with write permission and "./backups/.log" as parameters.
* if successfully opened the log file it calls the function log_wrapper() to write to log file that the backup starts.
* calls fopen with read permission and the file that we want to backup as its first parameter.
* if successfully opened the file , it calls open to creat the backup file inside the folder ./backups.
(if any error happens when reading or opening "./backups/.log", argv[1], it display error and exit)
* after that the main() start copying character by character from the file that we want to backup (argv[1]) to the backup file.
* calls log_wrapper() to write msg indecating that the backup finished to log file (./backups/.log).

==> to solve this challenge 
+ create a folder backups in /var/tmp
+ create a log file inside /var/tmp/backups/.log
+ create a symbolic link of /home/users/level09/.pass
+ execute /home/users/level08/level08 [symbolic link]

cd /var/tmp/ && mkdir backups && touch backups/.log && ln -s /home/users/level09/.pass .pass && /home/users/level08/level08 .pass
