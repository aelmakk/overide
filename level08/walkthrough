to test the log file i changed the backups/.log to /tmp/AAAA/.log
* open the backups folder and test if its opened successfuly  
* argv[1] 

possible exploit :
        * inject shellcode in file name


        * open return NULL while opening "./backups/.log" with "w" permision (verify with getfacl command) this happen at least in gdb
