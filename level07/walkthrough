possible exploit :

    * inject the shellcode in command buff.
    * overwrite the return address of main or other function to execute shellcode.
    ===> overiwting the return address of main didn't work since the offeset is + 14 from the end of buff, 

possible pyload :

    * [address of system] + [ adress of return of system]  + [adress of /bin/sh/]

since we can't write 3 continues value , the index of the return address of system could be in an index divisible by 3, it has no effect since the goal is to return to system .

--------------------------------------------------------------

the only thing last is to find a way to redirect the return to the address of our pyload
