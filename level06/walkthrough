* In this challenge the main() asks for a username , and a serial , than passes them as arguments to function auth() respectively. if the return is 0 the program prints "Authenticated!" and call system("/bin/sh"), else return (1).
* function auth first checks if the username is longer than 6 characters , if not it return 1
* if the username is longer enough it do some operations on the serial we provide, than it compares it with initial serial we provide .


==> I solved this challenge with following c program :

// login : AAAAAA | serial : 6229050

************************ to find serial ************************

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    unsigned int pass;
    unsigned int serial;
    int i;
    
    serial = 0;
    while (1)
    {
        pass = ('A' ^ 0x1337) + 0x5eeded;
		for (i = 0; i < 6; i++)
		{
			pass = pass + ('A' ^ pass) % 0x539;
		}
		if (serial == pass) {
			printf("%u\n", serial);
			break;
		}
		else {
		    serial += 1;
        }

    }
    return 0;
}

===> 6229050
