* in this level00 , the program prompt for a password .
* providing a wrong password print "invalid password" msg. else it calls system("/bin/sh").
* When looking  into the assembly using gdb , i found that the program compare the password we provide (expect an integer) with the value 5276.
==> giving 5276 as password gives a shell , so we can easily cat /home/users/level01/.pass.
